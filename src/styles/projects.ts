    info: `Sonic Gesture Challenge is a sound and gesture mapping game
      where the goal is to repeat a gesture after only hearing the
      sound it produces. This was a really fun project focusing on how to make sound
      designs for the web, using WebAudioXML by Hans Lindetorp, and
      exploring if it is feasible to use this framework for these
      kinds of ear-training apps.`,
